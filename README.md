## 😊 Emotion Detection Tracker

**Emotion-Detection-Tracker** is a machine learning-based application that detects whether a person appears **Happy 🙂** or **Unhappy 🙁** using facial expression analysis. The current version is designed to work with **stored images**, making it a lightweight and efficient tool for basic emotion recognition.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
* **Python:** The core programming language used to build and run the application.
* **OpenCV:** For image processing and face detection from static images.
* **TensorFlow:** To run the pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification.

### 🎯 Features:
* 📸 **Input:** Static images (photos) of individuals.
* 😊 **Output:** Binary emotion detection — **Happy** or **Unhappy**.
* 🧠 **Model:** Deep learning-based classifier trained on facial expression datasets.
* 🔍 **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV’s Haar cascades or DNN models to detect and extract faces before classification.

### 💡 Potential Improvements:
* Add **real-time webcam** emotion tracking.
* Expand emotion categories (e.g., **Neutral**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**).
* Build a **user interface** for easier input/output interaction.
* Store and visualize emotion trends over time using charts or logs.

### 📁 Use Cases:
* User sentiment analysis from profile photos.
* Preliminary tool for emotion-based research.
* Educational demonstration of facial expression recognition using AI.
